# mongo-sharding
Deploying and configuring the mongo shard on linux machine.
Here I'm going to deploy mongosharding with two sharded cluster and each shard have 3(P-S-S) nodes and 3(P-S-S) configuration cluster and one Mongos.
As I have only one machine so I'm deploying all the above node on a single machine, so we have total 10 running mongo instances on single machine.
